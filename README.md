# Strategoal

## Description
Strategoal is a two-player LAN-based strategy game developed in 2018 as a school project. Inspired by the classic board game Stratego, this game was created to demonstrate networking, game design, and programming skills. Players compete against each other by strategically moving pieces and capturing the opponent's pieces, with a leaderboard system that tracks players' performance using an SQL database.

## Project Background
* **Created in:** 2018
* **Context:** High school computer science project
* **Goal:** Develop a multiplayer network game using Python

## Important Setup Note
ðŸš¨ **IMPORTANT:** If the project on your computer includes the "Graphics" folder, extract ALL files from this folder directly into the main project folder for the game to function correctly.

## Features
* **Multiplayer gameplay:** Two players can connect over a LAN and compete
* **Graphical game interface:** Powered by Pygame for an interactive and engaging game experience
* **Leaderboard system:** Players can create an account, and their win/loss records are stored in the server's database
* **Strategic gameplay:** Classic Stratego-inspired piece movement and capture mechanics

## Requirements
* **Python Version:** Python 2.x
* **Required Libraries:**
   * `Pygame` (for game graphics and interaction)
   * `sqlite3` (for the leaderboard database)
   * `Tkinter` (for additional UI elements)

## Installation and Setup
1. Clone the repository from GitHub
2. If a "Graphics" folder exists, extract ALL its contents to the main project folder
3. Ensure you have Python 2 installed
4. Install required libraries:
   ```sh
   pip install pygame sqlite3
   ```
5. Run the server:
   ```sh
   python Server.py
   ```
6. Run the client:
   ```sh
   python Client.py
   ```

## How to Play
* Start the server and wait for a player to connect
* Each player should run `Client.py` and enter the server's IP address
* Use the Pygame interface to strategically move your pieces
* Capture opponent's pieces and aim to win the game
* The leaderboard will update automatically based on game results

## Game Mechanics
* Two players compete on a grid-based battlefield
* Each player has a set of pieces with different ranks and abilities
* Strategic placement and movement are key to victory
* Pieces can be captured based on their relative ranks

## Troubleshooting
* If the game fails to launch, ensure all files from the "Graphics" folder are extracted to the main project directory
* Verify that all required libraries are installed
* Check that you are using Python 2.x

## Note
This project was developed as a school project in 2018, showcasing early programming skills in network game development.
